#3.2 Multivariate logistic regression

#3.2.1. Letâ€™s create the variable CRM1000 = 1000  (crimes/popul) 
#that is number of crimes per 1,000 people. Check if CRM1000 alone 
#is relevant to explain the probability of high unemployment by fitting a 
#simple logistic regression model. Now consider the multivariate logistic model 
#having region and crm1000 as covariates, what are your considerations? Discuss in detail.

#covariate CRM1000.
